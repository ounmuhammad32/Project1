        <p class="fs-5"><span class="fs-3">P</span>yTest is a testing framework that allows users to write test codes
            using Python programming language. It helps you to write simple and scalable test cases for databases, APIs,
            or UI. PyTest is mainly used for writing tests for APIs. It helps to write tests from simple unit tests to
            complex functional tests.

                    Each section on the test can also b individually ran directly in file editing window.
                    In this case Pytesy will also be performed each time new content is pushed to repository per
                    worklflow.

        <h4><u>What is Flask></u></h4>
        <p class="fs-5"><strong><span class="fs-3">F</span>lask</strong> is a lightweight web application framework
            designed to make getting
            started quick and easy." It is a Python module, which means that the entire framework is written in Python
            code.
            The repository for this application is hosted on GitHub here. Additionally, here are the Heroku links for
            the
            Production and Development Environments for this application.</p>

                <p class="fs-5"><strong><span class="fs-3">F</span>lask Blueprints</strong> encapsulate functionality
                    for the web app, such as views and templates. It is a very helpful
                    way to organize and work with an application. For this application, I utilize Flask Blueprints for
                    the bundle of
                    controllers that handle routes within the app itself. As you can see in the image to the right, this
                    application
                    uses Flask to import a Blueprint template that is then used to make the bundle of controllers that
                    allow for
                    correct routing between pages.</p>

                <p class="fs-5"><strong><span class="fs-3">S</span>imple Pages</strong> is a bundle of controllers made
                    from a Flask Blueprint. With Simple Pages, I was able ability
                    to make template folders that then "speak to one another" efficiently. For this app, we utilize this
                    method to
                    have all the html pages of the site return and route correctly by having a parent "base.html" file
                    living within
                    the root of the app. Any of the internal pages will return correctly in this manner without having
                    to add
                    additional code.</p>
